Project Description
This project focuses on mastering core JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling concepts. It includes exercises on element selection, traversal, content modification, dynamic element creation/removal, event handling, event propagation, delegation, form validation, and a fully functional To-Do List application with localStorage persistence.

Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
Features
DOM element selection using getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll
DOM traversal (parent, children, siblings navigation)
Content manipulation (textContent vs innerHTML)
Attribute handling (get/set/remove attributes, data attributes)
Dynamic styling via JavaScript
Creating, inserting, cloning, and removing elements
Event handling (mouse, keyboard, form, window events)
Event object usage (target, preventDefault, stopPropagation)
Event bubbling and delegation
Form validation with real-time feedback
Interactive To-Do List with localStorage persistence
Daily challenges (Color Changer, Dynamic Elements, Image Remover, Content Copier, Dark Mode)
How to Run
Clone this repository
Open index.html in your browser OR Open any HTML file directly:
index.html - Full To-Do List application
task-list.html - Event delegation demo
DOM Assignments/practice.html - All DOM exercises
DOM Assignments/day1-color-changer.html - Day 1 challenge
DOM Assignments/day2-dynamic-elements.html - Day 2 challenge
DOM Assignments/day3-image-remover.html - Day 3 challenge
DOM Assignments/day4-content-copier.html - Day 4 challenge
DOM Assignments/day5-dark-mode.html - Day 5 challenge
Lessons Learned
Difference between HTML attributes vs DOM properties
DOM updates are destructive by default (innerHTML overwrites)
Importance of event delegation for dynamic elements
How event bubbling works (child → parent → grandparent)
Safe vs unsafe DOM manipulation (textContent vs innerHTML)
Structuring code to avoid conflicts between multiple DOM operations
Using localStorage for persistent data storage
CSS custom properties for theme switching
Modern DOM methods (prepend, append, before, after)
Challenges Faced
Elements returning null due to incorrect selectors
Content disappearing due to multiple DOM overwrites
Event delegation issues fixed using closest()
Reusing DOM elements without cloning
Form validation not triggering due to incorrect function structure
Preventing destructive operations during demo (commented out)
Managing state for filters and task completion
Bug Fixes Applied
✅ Fixed task-list.js: Toggle completed class on parent li instead of span ✅ Fixed dom.js: Commented out destructive DOM operations ✅ Fixed dom.js: Proper error message creation and removal ✅ Fixed dom.js: Corrected event delegation selector (ul.nav-list) ✅ Fixed dom.js: Restructured form validation function scope ✅ Added proper error styling and message display
